      <p>To The Sky by MayhemTheFinesseGod is yet another one of M.T.F.G's great works. This project was also marketed well on Mayhem's socials and did well compared to Mayhem's other music when it came out. To The Sky came out on January 19th, 2022 on all platforms and was quite a different style of music when compared to Mayhem's other songs/raps.
